Sometimes when developing projects, we need to take a screenshot and send to a person...

Im lazy so i dont want to do this all of the time:
- find/remmeber a tool to take screenshot...
- find where the screenshot is located on computer...
- turn skype/emails attach file and send...


This script can make this process better, by opening in your browser the image...
